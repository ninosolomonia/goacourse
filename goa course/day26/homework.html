            The twenty-fourth season of the American reality television series The Voice 
            premiered on September 25, 2023, on NBC.<br> The season is presented by Carson Daly, 
            who returned for his twenty-fourth season as the host. <br>This season's coaching 
            panel consists of Niall Horan, who returned for his second season; John Legend
            and Gwen Stefani, who both returned for their eighth and seventh seasons,
            respectively,after a one-season hiatus; and debuting coach Reba McEntire.
            <br>

            Huntley was named as the winner of the season at the season finale aired on 
            December 19, 2023. <br>
            His victory marks Niall Horan's second consecutive win
            as a coach, with Horan becoming the third coach to win multiple 
            consecutive seasons, following Blake Shelton's winning streak from 
            seasons 2 to 4, and Kelly Clarkson's consecutive wins in seasons 14 and 15
            Horan is also the second coach (after Clarkson) to win their first two 
            seasons.
