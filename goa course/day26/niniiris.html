            Nini Iris (4-chair turn) — TOP 9
            Hometown: Tbilisi, Georgia
            Nini loves and misses her home country of Georgia, 
            but always dreamed of moving to the U.S. In 2012, she auditioned for 
            the Georgian format of “The Voice” and made it all the way to live shows.
            In 2016, she decided to move to New York alone, but once she arrived 
            Nini barely had enough money to survive, so she contacted the former 
            social media manager for the show, Saba, who was an acquaintance, at 
            the time. He was also just getting by in New York, so they moved into 
            a hostel together and became best friends. Eventually, Nini started 
            singing at a cabaret show, which opened the door for her to meet people
            in the wedding industry. She transitioned to be a wedding singer while
            taking on various odd jobs until she was finally able to become a 
            full-time wedding and events singer.
