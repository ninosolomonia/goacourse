    <!--A declaration consists of two parts: a property and a value.


You can use a combination of selectors to make more precise rules.
The descendant selector targets children inside a specific parent. 
It consists of the parent selector, followed by a space,
 followed by the child selector.-->


 <!-- Well done! You’ve learned that:

 

⭐ By default, a child element will inherit style from its parent

⭐ You can override style inheritance by creating a different rule for the child element

⭐ The descendant selector targets a child nested inside a specific parent -->
<!--  
Each type of CSS selector has its place in this priority list. When several 
CSS rules target the same HTML element, the browser uses this order to 
decide which rule to apply.
Inline styles
Id
Classes
Elements
This priority order is known as specificity. Specificity is the algorithm
 used by browsers to determine the rule to apply to an element.

This is needed because an HTML element can be targeted in different ways


One of the advantages of external CSS is that the same CSS styles file can be used
by multiple HTML documents (or web pages)
