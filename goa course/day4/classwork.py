# flow of instructions a computer follows, using 3 techniques: sequencing, iteration and selection.
#sequencing- the computer runs your code in order, from top to bottom.
#Iteration-executing an instruction repeatedly. Iteration is commonly represented as a loop
#Selection specifies when to follow each path.
#An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to complete a task, placed in a certain order.
#flowcharts help to visualize algorithms.
#Comparison and logical operations are needed to control the flow of your programs.
#Another way to represent an algorithm is with pseudocode.
# A for loop is used to execute the same instruction over and over again,a specific number of times.
# Pseudocode is a simplified language that is a bit closer to a programming language.
#for i in range(3):
#    print("Hello") #use 2 spaces or 4 spaces
 #range() generates a series of integer numbers.
 #  The i variable is used to iterate over the numbers.
 #The initial loop statement must be followed by a colon : symbol. 
 # This signals the start of the iteration block.
 #for i in range(5):
  #print("For Loop")
  #Loops usually include counters. 
  # A coseats = 300
#while seats > 0:
  #print("Sell ticket")
  #seats = seats - 1unter is a variable that keeps track of the number of iterations
  #Counter variables are updated inside the loop, so they change with every iteration
  #An initial value is set outside the loop, as the starting point.
  #use for loops when you already know the number of iterations, 
  # and while loops when there is a condition that needs to be met.
  #you can apply iteration to your programs with the while loop

 #counters keep track of the number of iterations and avoid infinite loops

 #indentation and the colon : symbol are required for the code to run
