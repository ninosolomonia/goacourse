# flow of instructions a computer follows, using 3 techniques: sequencing, iteration and selection.
#sequencing- the computer runs your code in order, from top to bottom.
#Iteration-executing an instruction repeatedly. Iteration is commonly represented as a loop
#Selection specifies when to follow each path.
#An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to complete a task, placed in a certain order.
#flowcharts help to visualize algorithms.
#Comparison and logical operations are needed to control the flow of your programs.
